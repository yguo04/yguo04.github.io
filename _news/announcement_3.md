:sparkles: I'm very proud to release the recent work led by me, [ui-nexus](https://ui-nexus.github.io/)(introduction video, demo and paper are available in the project link nowðŸ”¥). We introduce a comprehensive benchmark, UI-NEXUS, for compositional mobile device operation tasks and propose a scheduling system for mobile agent, Agent-NEXUS. Thanks to all my awesome collaborators!
