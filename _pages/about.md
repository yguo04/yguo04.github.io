I am a junior undergraduate in Yongqiang honor class of computer science, School of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Zhuosheng Zhang](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhangzs/). My research experience is further enriched by a concurrent internship at [Langboat Technology](https://www.langboat.com/en), where I enjoy the privilege of working closely with Prof. [Ming Zhou](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=a0w5c0gAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests broadly lie in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and their interdisciplinary applications. Recently, I have been focusing on computer-using agents and agent safety.

I have received the National Scholarship of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (awarded to the top 0.2% of students nationwide), the Fan-Xuji Scholarship at SJTU (awarded to 15 outstanding undergraduates annually), as well as the SJTU Academic Scholarship and the Yongqiang Encouragement Scholarship. I have earned straight A grades in all undergraduate courses related to mathematics and physics, and Iâ€™m a member of Fan-Xuji and Rongchang alumni associations.

ðŸ”¥ I am actively looking for a PhD position starting from 26 fall! ðŸ”¥
